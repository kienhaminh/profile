Retrieve a single hashtag by its UUID.

```http
GET /api/hashtags/{id}
```

**Path Parameters:**

## Usage

Hashtags are used to categorize both blog posts and projects. They can be associated with:

- Blog posts via `hashtagIds` array during creation/update
- Projects via `hashtagIds` array during creation/update

This allows for cross-content discovery and filtering.
