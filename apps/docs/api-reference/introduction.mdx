## Authentication

### Public Endpoints
Most endpoints are publicly accessible for reading published content. No authentication required.

### Admin Endpoints
Admin endpoints require authentication via HTTP-only cookies set during login. The API uses secure token-based authentication with CSRF protection.

```typescript
// Admin login sets HTTP-only cookie
POST /api/admin/login
{
  "username": "admin",
  "password": "password"
}

// Subsequent admin requests include the cookie automatically
GET /api/admin/posts
```

## Response Format

All API responses follow a consistent JSON format:

```typescript
// Success response
{
  "data": { /* response data */ },
  "status": 200
}

// Error response
{
  "error": "Error message",
  "status": 400
}
```

## Rate Limiting

Public endpoints have rate limiting to prevent abuse. Admin endpoints require authentication and are additionally protected.
