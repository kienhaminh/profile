## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30

- Q: How does "blog" relate to the existing "posts" table in the database schema? ‚Üí A: "Blogs" and "posts" are the same - enhance existing posts table/functionality (posts shows all the blogs)
- Q: Are "categories" for blogs the same as the existing "topics" table? ‚Üí A: Yes, categories = topics (use existing topics table)
- Q: How should hashtags be implemented and managed? ‚Üí A: Managed entities with separate hashtags table (reusable across posts/projects). Hashtags can be added by admin and attached to each blog (many-to-many). Visitors can filter blogs by hashtags, topics, or titles from main site.
- Q: What are the required attributes/fields for a Project entity? ‚Üí A: Title, description, images, GitHub URL, live URL, tech stack, dates (hashtags not required, but tech stack enables filtering)
- Q: Can a blog post be assigned to multiple topics (categories) or just one? ‚Üí A: Multiple topics (many-to-many: blog can have multiple topics, already exists via post_topics table)
- Q: Can admins create topics and hashtags inline while editing content? ‚Üí A: Yes, admins can create topics inline directly and create hashtags inline
- Q: Are topics flat or hierarchical? ‚Üí A: Start with flat topics and flat hashtags first; hierarchical structure will be implemented later
- Q: Are there limits on number of topics/hashtags per item? ‚Üí A: Unlimited fields first (no limits initially)
- Q: Who can perform CRUD operations on blogs, projects, topics, and hashtags? ‚Üí A: Only the super admin (only me)
- Q: What validation rules are needed? ‚Üí A: No validation rules currently (start simple)
- Q: Should tech stack be a managed entity table or simple text array? ‚Üí A: Managed entity table (like hashtags/topics for consistent filtering and reusability across projects)
- Q: What happens when deleting a topic, hashtag, or technology that's in use? ‚Üí A: Cascade delete (auto-remove associations when entity is deleted)

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As the super administrator, I need to create, read, update, and delete blog posts and projects through a management interface, so that I can maintain the portfolio website's content with proper metadata (blogs with topics/categories and hashtags, projects with tech stack and optional hashtags) to help visitors discover and explore content effectively.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Blog Management:**

1. **Given** I am the super administrator, **When** I create a new blog post with title, content, topics (categories), and hashtags, **Then** the blog must be saved with all associated metadata and be retrievable.

2. **Given** a blog post exists in the system, **When** I view the blog list, **Then** I must see all blogs with their topics (categories) and hashtags displayed.

3. **Given** I have selected an existing blog post, **When** I update its content, topics (categories), or hashtags, **Then** the changes must be persisted and reflected immediately.

4. **Given** a blog post exists in the system, **When** I delete it, **Then** the blog and its associations must be removed from the system.

**Project Management:**

5. **Given** I am the super administrator, **When** I create a new project with title, description, images, GitHub URL, live URL, technologies (from tech stack), and dates, **Then** the project must be saved with all metadata and be retrievable.

6. **Given** a project exists in the system, **When** I view the project list, **Then** I must see all projects with their key details (title, description, images, URLs, technologies, dates) displayed.

7. **Given** I have selected an existing project, **When** I update its details (title, description, images, URLs, technologies, dates), **Then** the changes must be persisted and reflected immediately.

8. **Given** a project exists in the system, **When** I delete it, **Then** the project and its associations must be removed from the system.

9. **Given** a visitor is browsing the main site, **When** they filter projects by technology (from tech stack), **Then** the system must display matching projects.

10. **Given** I am creating or editing a project, **When** I select technologies from the existing tech stack list or create new technologies inline, **Then** the technologies must be created (if new) and associated with the project.

**Category and Hashtag Management:**

10. **Given** I am creating or editing a blog, **When** I select one or more topics (categories) from the existing topics list or create new topics inline, **Then** the topics must be created (if new) and associated with the blog via the post_topics junction table.

11. **Given** I am creating or editing content, **When** I select hashtags from the existing hashtag list or create new hashtags inline, **Then** the hashtags must be created (if new) and associated with the content.

12. **Given** a visitor is browsing the main site, **When** they filter content by hashtags, topics, or titles, **Then** the system must display matching blog posts.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an administrator tries to create a blog without a required field? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which fields are required?]
- What happens when a topic (category) is deleted that is assigned to existing blogs? Cascade deletion removes the topic associations from blogs automatically (blog remains, just loses the topic association).
- What happens when trying to delete a blog or project that doesn't exist? System must handle gracefully with appropriate error message.
- What happens when two administrators edit the same content simultaneously? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: conflict resolution strategy?]
- What happens when filtering by hashtag or topic on the main site returns no results? System must display appropriate empty state message.
- What happens when a hashtag is deleted that is assigned to existing posts/projects? Cascade deletion removes the hashtag associations from posts and projects automatically (content remains, just loses the hashtag association).

- **FR-022**: System MUST allow the super administrator full permissions (create, read, update, delete) for all entities without restrictions.

**Validation:**

- **FR-023**: System MUST validate required fields before saving blogs or projects (validation rules to be defined as needed during implementation).

- **FR-024**: System MUST prevent duplicate slugs for blogs, projects, topics, and hashtags (slugs must be unique within their entity type).

- **FR-025**: System MUST validate basic format requirements (e.g., URLs must be valid HTTP/HTTPS), with no hard limits on number of topics or hashtags per item initially. Start with minimal validation; add rules as needed.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Blog Post (Posts Table)**: Uses the existing `posts` table which already has title, content, status, publication metadata, and author reference. This feature enhances it with category/categories and hashtags management.

- **Project**: Represents a portfolio project with attributes: title, description, images (array/multiple), GitHub URL, live/demo URL, technologies (many-to-many relationship with tech stack table), project dates (start date, end date/ongoing status), and optional hashtags via many-to-many relationship.

- **Topic (Category)**: Uses the existing `topics` table for blog post classification with flat structure (no hierarchy initially; nested topics deferred to future). The existing `post_topics` junction table handles the many-to-many relationship (each blog can have multiple topics, each topic can be assigned to multiple blogs). Super administrator can create topics inline while editing blogs.

- **Hashtag**: Managed entity stored in a separate hashtags table with attributes (id, name, slug, description). Flat structure (no hierarchy). Reusable across both blog posts and projects via many-to-many relationships. Super administrator can create hashtags inline while editing content. No limit on number of hashtags per blog or project initially.

- **Blog-Hashtag Association**: Represents the many-to-many relationship between blogs and hashtags.

- **Project-Hashtag Association**: Represents the optional many-to-many relationship between projects and hashtags (hashtags are not required for projects).

- **Technology (Tech Stack)**: Managed entity stored in a separate technologies/tech_stack table with attributes (id, name, slug, description). Reusable across projects via many-to-many relationship. Super administrator can create technologies inline while editing projects. Enables visitors to filter projects by technology.
