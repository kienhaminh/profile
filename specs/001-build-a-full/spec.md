## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: How will blog posts be authored and published? ‚Üí A: Admin UI with local auth; include a dashboard to manage posts and track performance/monitoring.
- Q: How should analytics/monitoring be captured? ‚Üí A: GA4 for visits/metrics; enable Google Ads on blog.

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a visitor, I want to quickly understand who Kien is, view selected projects, and read blog posts (including AI-related topics), so that I can evaluate his expertise and interests.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a visitor lands on the home page, **When** they scroll, **Then** they see name, role, a concise summary, prominent navigation to Projects and Blog, and clear contact links.
2. **Given** a visitor is on the Projects section, **When** they view a project card, **Then** they see title, brief description, role/tech context, and a link to details/case study.
3. **Given** a visitor is on the Blog index, **When** they filter by a topic (e.g., AI, Backend, Career), **Then** the list updates to show only posts in that topic.
4. **Given** a visitor opens a blog post, **When** the content renders, **Then** the article is easy to read with headings, code formatting, images/captions (if any), related topics, and an estimated read time.
5. **Given** no posts match a selected topic, **When** the list renders, **Then** the UI shows a friendly empty state and a way to clear the filter.

### Edge Cases
- No projects defined: show an informative empty state and contact link.
- Very long blog post with code blocks: ensure typography, spacing, and code formatting remain readable.
- Multiple topics per post: ensure filtering intersects correctly and chips/badges are visually consistent.
- Broken links or missing images: render a fallback and surface an error state that doesn‚Äôt break reading.
- 404 navigation to non-existent post: show a helpful not-found page with links back to Blog and Home.
- Draft posts MUST not appear publicly; only visible in CMS to admin.
- Publishing/unpublishing transitions MUST be idempotent and clearly reflected in the dashboard state.

- **FR-015**: Provide an admin CMS/dashboard to create, edit, publish/unpublish, and delete blog posts (role‚Äërestricted).
- **FR-016**: Protect CMS/dashboard with local admin authentication; only authenticated admin can access.
